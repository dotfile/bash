Bash configuration
==================
My bash terminal configurations.

Much of these configs are ancient and are abandoned; as such, they are skipped
in the 'installation' step. They'll be culled in the future.

Installation
------------

```
cd ~/.config
git clone git@github.com:dotfile/bash.git

ln -s ~/.config/bash/inputrc ~/.inputrc
```

Other Configs
-------------
* [bash](https://github.com/dotfile/bash)
* [tmux](https://github.com/dotfile/tmux)
* [vim](https://github.com/dotfile/vim)
